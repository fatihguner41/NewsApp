# newsapp
We are using Python with BS4 web scraping to fetch news from the top 20 newspaper websites in Turkey and save them to our Firebase database. This saving process is automatically triggered every 5 minutes on a Replit virtual machine, allowing us to receive new articles 7/24.

Through our designed mobile application, we are connecting our users with personalized news. Our algorithm in main menu provides us a news scoring system. This system scores hottest news based on users like history. And if a new gets more score, it's more likely to be shown to user in main menu.

We also have a side bar where users can choose any category like sports, daily, science... Or any newspaper like Sabah, Cumhuriyet...

There is a search bar for users to search any detailed new. In example user can write "Messi" and see all the hottest news about footballer Lionel Messi.

Users can like and save the news they enjoy.
